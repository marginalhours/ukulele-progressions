# Design notes

- Panel colours should be meaningful; I suggest 8 tones that go well together for intervals (I II III etc) plus variations for min/maj/dim7 &c
- Think _hard_ about what happens on mobile (maybe drop the panels and use the colours as fretboard borders)
- We really need to work out what to do about mobile (can't press space there)
- Stretch goals: Note labels, barring, etc
